I started using instagram shortly before the twins were born, early 2011.  This ended up being pretty good timing; its been a great place to put some of my favorite photos.  When the girls start acting like sassy teenagers (at 5), I can easly look back at the pictures of when they were sweet innocent babes.  

Here are some of my favorite pics from my feed.
