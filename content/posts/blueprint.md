So this is more or less the Blueprint I follow for my life.  This is a somewhat sarcastic response to [Bryan Johnson (entrepreneur)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson_(entrepreneur))'s [Blueprint](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co/), which I find 50% facinating & 50% utterly ridiculous.


## Just Keep Running

Being healthy and feeling physically good are one of the few things I feel ok being a bit selfish about.  It may sound obvious, but you will likely only have one body for your entire life; you should probably prioritize taking care of it.  I take roughly an hour each day to exercise in the morning, which currently is a run of 3-5 miles at ~6:30am.  I found myself waking up at this time anyway, and it works good for me to get out of the house before its overly hot, and before the kids have fully terrorized my wife (god bless her soul).

Basically, if I can stay healthy enough to do this 6 days a week, I'll stay in pretty good shape, regardless of the contents of the rest of the routine.

In the winter, when us poor saps in the Midwest can't leave the house without freezing off important body parts, I sub this with 20m on the exercise bike.  I'm looking to get a rowing machine prior to next winter, for some variety in workouts.

## The Rest of the Routine

* Take 1 SUPER-B-COMPLEX (Costco brand) per day, when I remember
* Drink 4-5 L of H2O per day
* Favor eating protien over carbs, in all cases possible:
  - NO pop, ever.  fuck that shit, even the zero sugar ones.  Just cut it out.
  - Don't do buns
  - Replace sugary snacks with nuts & protien bars
  - Don't drink beer.  It makes you feel like shit.  Also it doesn't taste good anyway.  Take a shot a vodka if you need it instead.
* Keep stress low
  - Do your work.  Do it well.
  - Don't take on everything.

And that is basically it.

## Results

My `Garmin FORERUNNER 645 MUSIC` watch says I have a `vo2max of 54`, which puts me just 2 points shy of a guy who has spent $2 million and wasted countless medical professional's time where they could be helping actually people with medical issues.
