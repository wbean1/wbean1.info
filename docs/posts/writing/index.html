<p>Like probably every human that is not a profesional writer, I find it fairly difficult to get into a writing flow-state.  I then use this as an excuse <em>not</em> to write, and to think I&rsquo;m bad at it.  I&rsquo;ve never been great at expressing emotions, and even when speaking frequently the words just seem to come from some place other than my brain.</p>
<p>I have recently been inspired to give this writing thing another go.  You don&rsquo;t get better at something by avoiding it, and, as they say in the business, <strong>&ldquo;scared monkey don&rsquo;t make monkey&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="i-once-had-a-book-idea">I once had a book idea</h2>
<p>Looking back on it, it still seems like the strangest thing.  We were driving back home from the hospital in Peoria from one of my daugher&rsquo;s many appointments (she had a number of heart defects that still require regular checkups, but thats another story), and I think my brain sorta just clicked into some strange creative gear.</p>
<p>The premise of the book was that a human scientist invented a way to transfer a human&rsquo;s memory bank, and thus debatably their conscienceness, to another human.  However there were a few caveats to making the process work reliably:</p>
<ol>
<li>the recipient needed to be fairly young, say between 5-6 years old, for a whole host of reasons that could go into the book.</li>
<li>the recipient should be either an identical twin, or full clone of the &ldquo;donor&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>This discovery, and its implementation, led to widespread changes in human sociological constructs &ndash; from marriage, to professional application, sports, politics, space travel; literally the entire world changed due to this technology.</p>
<p>My flow state thinking about this world, and all the people-impacting-changes and stories that could be told, kept branching and leading me to strange new nuances of the story.  Humanity would need to weed out dementia-causing illnesses like Alzheimers, perhaps brutally? Any suicidal tendencies would also need to be rooted out of the idyllic gene-pool, because you wouldn&rsquo;t want to invest a 10-lifetime memory bank to someone who might just dead-end it.</p>
<p>I still remember driving across the cornfields in Illinois, literally chuckling as I thought about all these things.  What would the process look like?  I imagined it being turned into some quasi-religious rite-of-passage, where an innocent, normal-looking 5-6 year old is led, robe clad behind some curtain, and emerges with 10 lifetimes worth of knowledge and memory of previously led lives, as if they were its own.</p>
<p>The scientist who created this tech was still alive and being &ldquo;snap-shotted&rdquo; to new recipients some 2,000 years later.  He&rsquo;s seen his technology change the world, and is the only one who is still around from the beginning of it all.  And as he&rsquo;s about to be given another award for this world-altering technology, he looks around at all the new problems that have been created, and he regrets it all.  So he changes his ruling-class-approved speach and does the one thing he knows that might help end the practice; he urges people to rise against it, pulls out a revolver, and ends his life on live television.</p>
<p>Sheesh.</p>
<p>Anyways, that was the premise of the book.  And I&rsquo;ve sat down, maybe once or twice, to try and start it.  I never get very far.  I dunno, maybe its too much to tackle without some form of warm-up or practice.</p>
<p>So thats what I&rsquo;m going to start using this blog for: practice.</p>
<p>There is also some professional development going on here, maybe.  My current employment is basically predicated on my ability to transcribe what I learn when I do a thing, so that others going down whatever path I&rsquo;m on will have an easier &amp; more successful time than I.  Writing &amp; summarizing these notes does not come easy to me.  But as they say in the business, <strong>&ldquo;practice makes porpoise&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
